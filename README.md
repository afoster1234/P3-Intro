# Project 3: FPS Tutorial

Tutorial Implementation | Austin Foster

## Project Report
This project was quite an experience for me because I did not realize the complextity curve was this high. Now it was a manageable type of complex, yet I feel like if I were to have made it to step 6, it would've been one of the largest applications I have ever worked on. With that said, I did like the way Godot does their tutorials because they are easy to follow along with and do a really good job explaining why everything exists and what they do. This project for me really highlights the major topics that we have learned thus far and pretty much amplifies them if you will. This for me was a bit overwhelming, specifically reforming the project structure to conform to our style guide gave me quite a fuss. Overall, I think that this project is a really good foot in the door for FPS style games and is a bit much for my personal liking. Either way this porject was fun to recreate and I think I did an okay job.
